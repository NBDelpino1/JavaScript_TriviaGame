            <p>
                I am humble person who is eager to learn and willing to go the extra mile to succeed in this industry.
                I just graduated from the UCF coding bootcamp with a good understanding of the fundamentals of Full Stack Web Development.
            </p>
            <p>
                My strengths are in UI/UX. I truly enjoy the creative aspect of it. I come from a banking background however
                I decided it was time to start doing something that would bring me joy at the end of the day instead of just a paycheck.
                After much thought I decided on web development. I have always been intrigued by design and have a strong curiosity to
                know how things work so web development seemed like a good fit. Ever since then it has been quite the journey but I love it.
                I can spend hours doing this and it doesnâ€™t feel like work to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of my projects are coded with using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap or Materialize with a little jQuery. I took a liking for the PHP-Laravel
                framework and plan on integrating it into all of my projects. Most projects are a work in progress and I continue
                work on them whenever possible. In my spare time I also like fiddling around with front end frameworks.
